<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Suwagath, and I'm a 17-year-old software engineering undergraduate 
  from Colombo, Sri Lanka. I'm currently in my freshman year, and I'm excited to be learning all 
  about software development.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about becoming a full-stack developer, and I'm working hard to develop my 
  knowledge and skills in this area. I'm following several online resources to learn everything I 
  need to know, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills.</p>

<p>As part of my journey towards becoming a full-stack developer, I've created this trial site. It 
  may look a little childish, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. I'm confident that with 
  time and practice, I'll be able to build a professional site that showcases my skills and abilities 
  as a developer. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site!
